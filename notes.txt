Notable:
First missing positive integer problem is interesting and not obvious.
possdecodenums: try to solve
univTree: not too hard; worth doing again to work on flow control

Reviewed once:
maxIsland: the leetcode solution is better than mine. try to solve
pairsconstructing is really FUN. very nonintuitive

Future:
look up and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)

DCP:
2-8

Ugh I don't want to deal with 6
