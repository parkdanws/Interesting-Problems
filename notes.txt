Notable:
First missing positive integer problem is interesting and not obvious.
possdecodenums: try to solve
univTree: not too hard; worth doing again to work on flow control
lru: it became a systems problem, not an algorithm. worth doing again just to
be better at writing systems, or thinking of algorithms to avoid complex systems

Reviewed once:
maxIsland: the leetcode solution is better than mine. try to solve
pairsconstructing is really FUN. very nonintuitive

Future:
look up and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)
fisher-yates shuffle: shuffle problem: why??

DCP:
2-8

Ugh I don't want to deal with 6

49-52
